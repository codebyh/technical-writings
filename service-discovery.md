Service Discovery
To automatically detect the service without need to specify the hard-coded IP or hostname of a service. Especially in micro-service architecture where there are too many services to handle, and every service is interacting with one or the other service. It would be a chaos to change the destination IP/Port or incase of service downtime. 

These micro-services uses service registries and a service discovery protocol (SDP) to accomplish this.
