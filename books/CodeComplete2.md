* Problem definition
* Requirements development
* Construction planning
* Software architecture, or high-level design
* Detailed design
* Coding and debugging
* Unit testing
* Integration testing

* System testing
* Corrective maintenance

## 2 Metaphors for a Richer Understanding of Software Development

Software industry is a younger field than most other sciences. It's not yet mature enough to have a set of standard metaphors. How well you understand the metaphors determines how well you understand software development. 

A metaphor serves more as heuristic than it does as algorithm. An algorithm is set of well-defined instructions for carrying out a particular task. A heuristic is a technique that helps you look for an answer. Its result are subject to change because a heuristic tells you only how to look, not what to find.
