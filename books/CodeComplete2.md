## Welcome to Software Construction

Developing computer software can be a complicated process, distinct activities that go into software development. They include:
* Problem definition
* Requirements development
* Construction planning
* Software architecture, or high-level design
* Detailed design
* Coding and debugging
* Unit testing
* Integration testing
* Integration
* System testing
* Corrective maintenance

## 2 Metaphors for a Richer Understanding of Software Development

Software industry is a younger field than most other sciences. It's not yet mature enough to have a set of standard metaphors. How well you understand the metaphors determines how well you understand software development. 

A metaphor serves more as heuristic than it does as algorithm. An algorithm is set of well-defined instructions for carrying out a particular task. A heuristic is a technique that helps you look for an answer. Its result are subject to change because a heuristic tells you only how to look, not what to find. 

### Common Software Metaphors

* **Software Penmanship: Writing Code**
The letter-writing metaphor works adequately for small scale projects but for other purposes it doesn't describe software development fully or adequately.
* **Software Farming: Growing a System**
Envision creating software as something like planting seeds and growing crops. You design a piece, code a piece, test a piece, and add it to the system a little bit at a time. The incremental technique is valuable, but farming metaphor suggests you don't have control over how the software develops. 
* **Software Oyster Farming: System Accretion**
Words closely related to accretion are “incremental,” “iterative,” “adaptive,” and “evolutionary.” Incremental designing, building, and testing are some of the most powerful software development concepts available.
As a metaphor, the strength of the incremental metaphor is that it doesn’t over promise. The image of an oyster forming a pearl is a good way to visualize  incremental development, or accretion.
* **Software Construction: Building Software**
The building-construction metaphor is so powerful. Many terms common in software development derive from the building metaphor: software architecture, scaffolding, construction, tearing code apart, plugging in a class. You’ll probably
hear many more.
* **Applying Software Techniques: The Intellectual  Toolbox**
A good craftsman knows the right tool for the job and knows how to use it correctly. Programmers do too. The more you learn about programming, the more you fill your mental toolbox with analytical tools and the knowledge of when to use them and how to use
them correctly.
The toolbox metaphor helps to keep all the methods, techniques, and tips in perspective—ready for use when appropriate.

## 3 Measure Twice, Cut Once: Upstream Prerequisites

### Key Points
* The overarching goal of preparing for construction is risk reduction. Be sure your preparation activities are reducing risks, not increasing them.
* If you want to develop high-quality software, attention to quality must be part of the software-development process from the beginning to the end. Attention to quality at the beginning has a greater influence on product quality than attention at the end.
* Part of a programmer’s job is to educate bosses and coworkers about the software-development process, including the importance of adequate preparation before programming begins.
* The kind of project you’re working significantly affects construction prerequisites—many projects should be highly iterative, and some should be more sequential.
* If a good problem definition hasn’t been specified, you might be solving the wrong problem during construction.
* If a good requirements work hasn’t been done, you might have missed important details of the problem. Requirements changes cost 20 to 100 times as much in the stages following construction as they do earlier, so be sure the requirements are right before you start programming.
* If a good architectural design hasn’t been done, you might be solving the right problem the wrong way during construction. The cost of architectural changes increases as more code is written for the wrong architecture, so be sure the architecture is right too.
* Understand what approach has been taken to the construction prerequisites on your project and choose your construction approach accordingly.
